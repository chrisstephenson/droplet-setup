#   Virtual Host template  updated 2015-12-08
#
#   This is a template for setting up new virtual hosts on Apache under Debian
#   with some default security and other settings.
#   _domain_ is replaced by the actual domain name and ip number when the apachevirtualhostconfig script runs
#   this template through sed
#
#   Once the domain is set up you may need to hand edit the resulting config file
#   to meet the specific requirements of a particular virtual host. Don't forget
#   to comment your changes
#
#   Now works to Apache 2.4 with module access_compat *disabled*. No longer tries to support specific multiple IPs. You can have more than 1 IP, 
#   but all virtual hosts match all IPs

#   Match this virtual host to _domain_ and www._domain_ and all other subdomains of _domain_ 
#
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www._domain_
    ServerAlias _domain_
    ServerAlias *._domain_
    # 
    # set up a standard webmaster. You may want to make this a common address for the whole server,
    # otherwise you should be sure to set up the appropriate mail account or alias.
    # 
    ServerAdmin webmaster@_domain_
    #
    # Document root set up in the standard way. apachevirtualhostconfig will have created the directories
    #
    DocumentRoot /var/www/_domain_/webroot
    <Directory /var/www/_domain_/webroot>
    # .htaccess and .htpasswd banned
    AllowOverride none        
    # prevent directory listings
    Options -Indexes          
    # allow access to any documents not explicitly banned
    Require all granted    
    </Directory>
    #
    # If you plan to support any foreign characters, utf-8 is best, but not globally enabled in our set up
    # So we enable utf-8 in each domain separately via this template
    #
    AddDefaultCharset utf-8      
    AddCharset utf-8 .html
    #
    # As a default we serve index.html if no filename is specified in a directory
    # It may be necessary to add index.htm or index.php or other names to this line,
    # if we need these served as default. Order is significant.
    #
    <IfModule mod_dir.c>
        DirectoryIndex index.html
    </IfModule>
    #
    # Prevent php scripts going off and reading files from outside this directory. Like a chroot php jail
    #
    php_admin_value open_basedir "/var/www/_domain_/"
    #
    # Set up a log file in /var/log/apache2 for this virtual host
    #
    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/_domain__access.log combined
    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/_domain__error.log
</VirtualHost>
